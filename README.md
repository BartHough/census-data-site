# Census Data Site
Our application will be built to allow users to visualize governmental business and economy census data. This data is powerful, yet difficult to understand in a raw data format. By creating charts that are easy to read, users can come to conclusions about the data set and predict future census data.

In doing the above, our group seeks to learn skills that are valuable in today’s software development marketplace such as serverless architecture with AWS, ReactJS, and data visualizations using ChartJS.

## Plan of Attack
1. Chart  page w X Data from Census API
2. Time period buttons around chart
3. Create a home page with dropdowns for different data that leads to our chart page
4. Map that adds location configuration - might need an intermediate API to get US region from Lat-Long (we assume)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment
#### Deploying to Beta
Whenever we want to push a change to our AWS beta bucket, run `npm run build && npm run deploy-beta`
#### Deploying to Production
Whenever we want to push a change to our AWS production bucket, run `npm run build && npm run deploy-prod` 
We might consider adding a CICD pipeline later if we have extra time.
